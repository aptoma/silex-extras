============

A key feature of this repo is to not have to repeat boilerplate code across projects.
That means that it is a bit intrusive in setting up logging, error handlers and services,
which may or may not fit everyoneâ€™s needs. We are open for modifications that allow
overriding and extending behavior, but we are not likely to accept changes that will
require changing existing projects depending on this package. However, feel free to
voice any suggestions, and we might very well end up with a more flexible design.

Any contributions should follow the principles defined in [SOFT MANDEL](https://github.com/aptoma/softmandel).
